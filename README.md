# Advance Tools for Home Assistant

**A toolbox for the parts of Home Assistant that are still hard.**
Build wall-tablet dashboards without writing YAML, clean up the entities a
year of tinkering left behind, run a real alarm panel with a keypad, and see
what actually happened in your home — all from one hub, all visual, all
explained in plain language.

Runs as a Home Assistant add-on. No cloud, no account, no telemetry.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FFreeHaTools%2FAdvance-tools)

## Start with a finished dashboard, not an empty canvas

Pick a layout. Advance Tools looks at the entities your Home Assistant
reports *right now*, matches them to the places the layout needs them, shows
you every match before anything is created — then builds the dashboard.

![Starter Templates](docs/screenshots/starter-templates.jpg)

Four templates ship with it: **Family Home**, **Apartment**, **Security
Tablet** (portrait, built around the keypad) and **Vacation Rental**. Adding
your own is a JSON file, not a pull request.

## A security panel you'd actually mount by the door

Arm Home / Away / Night behind a PIN, with real exit and entry delays, and
choose exactly which sensors each mode watches and whether each one is
instant or delayed. When it trips: sirens, lights, locks, scenes, scripts,
and a camera snapshot attached to your phone alert.

![Security keypad skins](docs/screenshots/security-keypads.jpg)

Eleven keypad designs for the tablet by your front door — Matrix, Police,
Military, Vault, Neon, a classic beige alarm panel, a radar scope and a
siren bar. All pure CSS, no images, no libraries.

## Find the junk a year of tinkering left behind

Dead devices, unavailable and orphaned entities, duplicate names, flat
batteries — found, explained, and cleaned up with a drag-and-drop triage
board. Every deletion is logged, and it shows you which automations
reference an entity *before* you remove it.

## Install

1. **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store → ⋮ → Repositories**, and add:
   ```
   https://github.com/FreeHaTools/Advance-tools
   ```
2. Install **Advance Tools**, start it, and open it from the sidebar.
3. The setup wizard walks you through creating a password and building your
   first dashboard.

It runs **inside Home Assistant**, so there is nothing else to configure — no
second hostname, no reverse proxy, no forwarded port. Wherever you already
reach Home Assistant, you reach Advance Tools. Wall tablets can also connect
straight to port `8234`, which is what the installable app uses.

Needs Home Assistant OS or Supervised. Builds for `amd64`, `aarch64` and
`armv7`.

## Design principles

- **Visual first.** If it can be a grid, a dial, a drag or a preview, it is
  not a text box.
- **Explain everything.** Every non-obvious field has a `?` with a concrete
  example, and every tool has a "How it works" guide.
- **Never surprise the user.** Destructive actions preview exactly what will
  happen, imports write a rollback point first, and nothing is deleted
  quietly.
- **Honest about limits.** The alarm is a convenience layer that runs while
  Home Assistant runs — the docs say so rather than implying otherwise.
- **Your data stays yours.** Everything runs locally against the Supervisor
  API. No account, no cloud, no analytics.

## Security

There is no default password — a fresh install makes you create one before
anything works. Sign-in has brute-force protection with escalating lockout,
and a security log records sign-ins, failures and password changes. This
panel can unlock doors and disarm an alarm, so it is treated that way.

Don't expose port 8234 to the internet; use a VPN or a reverse proxy with
TLS.

## Contributing

Every tool is a self-contained plugin — a folder with `manifest.json`,
`tool.py` and a `static/` directory. Drop one in and it appears in the hub;
no core changes needed.

`python scripts/verify.py` runs the same checks CI does: syntax, JSON,
truncated files, mangled encodings, version consistency, tool manifests,
uncommitted files, and a real boot smoke test.
